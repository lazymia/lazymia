- 👋 Hi, I’m Chiamaka. For development purpose, `Lazymia`, for when I'm being a girly girl, `No Sugar Needed`. 
- 👀 ...and I do awemaxing things in software quality assurance. Consider me a `runaway` developer, but hey, I'm getting my things together for a come back.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java - not exactly pivoting, but looking to understand Java indepth to handle other automation frameworks, and from the looks of things, I did enjoy my time exploring the new language, but, I prefer JavaScript, so I'm back to facing it, wish me luck!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything software quality assurance and frontend development that requires my expertise
- 📫 How to reach me, shoot me an email @ hello.chiamaka@gmail.com
